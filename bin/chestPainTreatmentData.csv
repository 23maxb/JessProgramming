Coronary_Disease,You should see a cardiologist. 
Costochondritis,Costochondritis is just a fancy word for muscles that hurt. This is why it hurts extra when you are excercising. I recommend taking tylenol and motrin whenever the pain begins to bother you. Also if the pain is severe get an Angiogram to confirm its not a heart attack.
Heartburn,Heartburn is when acid comes up from the stomach to the mouth. Take pepcid or prylosic.
Stress,Sometimes extreme stress causes chest pain. If you think that your stress is not the cause you can retake the stress and just say you don't have stress.
Shingles,Shingles is the reoccurance of chicken pox. The rash is caused by infection of a single nerve. This is why the rash only occurs on one side. Take some Acyclovir.
Aortic_Dissection,To be honest if you actually had this you would not be taking this test you would probably be passed out or dialing 911. The pain is extremely severe and it feels like a ripping in your heart because it is. Go to the hospital. This is often caused by smoking.
Pulmonary_Embolism,This is an extremely rare cause of chest pain but you seem to have it. This is caused by a blod clot in some part of your body (usually leg). The primary cause of this is inactivity for extended periods of time. This can happen during plane flights or long car rides. 
Pericarditis,Pericarditis is caused by a virus or an autoimmune disease. This is the inflammation of wrapping around heart. Motrin or steroids treat this.
Pleurisy,Inflmation of wrapping around lung. Motrin or steroids treat this.
Collapsed_Lung,You have a collpased lung. Go to the hospital and they can treat this. 
Broken_Rib,This sounds worse than it acutally is. Do breathing exercises by breathing in and holding and then releasing. This will heal over time.
Pancreitis,Pancreitis is just another way to say gallstones. Get a blood test and an ultrasound to confirm this.
Pulmonary_Hypertension,You should see a cardiologist. This is a just a extreme case of high blood pressure.
Cancer,You should see a cardiologist and get surgery to get the tumor removed if possible.
